/**
 * Mapper:
 * A mapper is responsible for converting data between different object models,
 * typically between Entities (persistence layer) and DTOs (API layer).
 *
 * Role:
 * - Separates database logic from API logic
 * - Prevents exposing entities directly to the client
 * - Improves code readability, security, and maintainability
 *
 * Mapping:
 * Mapping defines how fields from one object are transferred to another,
 * especially when field names or structures differ.
 *
 * Example:
 * - entity.user.id  ->  dto.userId
 *
 * Mappers are usually used in the Service layer to prepare data
 * for REST API requests and responses.
